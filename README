Computer Science from the Bottom Up
-----------------------------------

You should be able to make the course materials by typing

make html (output in ./html directory)

or 

make pdf (output in csbu.pdf)

You will need a number of things for this to work out of the box.  If
you have the Debian packages

* GNU make
* docbook
* docbook-sgml
* docbook-dsssl
* jadetex/openjade
* docbook-utils
* transfig (for fig2dev)

you will probably be ok.

I am always interested in contribution and feedback so please feel
