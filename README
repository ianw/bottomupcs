Computer Science from the Bottom Up
-----------------------------------

You should be able to make the course materials by typing

make html (output in ./html directory)

or

make pdf (output in csbu.pdf)

Included for simplicity are the docbook dtds, xsl stylesheets and fop
distribution.  You need some other things for this to work out of the
box.  If you have the Debian packages

* java (1.8 ... 1.7 seems to have some issues with saxon; see
    https://sourceforge.net/p/docbook/bugs/1373/ )
* libxml2-utils
* jing
* transfig (for fig2dev)

you will probably be ok.

I am always interested in contribution and feedback so please feel
free to email
