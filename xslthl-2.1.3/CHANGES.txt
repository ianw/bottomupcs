2.1.3

* Added support for Saxon 9.6
* Restored Wiki documentation

2.1.0

* Bug fixes (NPE, IOB)
* Added support for SaxonEE connector
* Added new syntax highlighter for HTML
  Basicaly same as for XML, but handles better some edge cases
* New syntax configurations for:
  - bourne (Bourne shell)
  - css21/css (Cascading Stylesheets version 2.1)
  - cmake
  - upc (Unified Parallel C)
  - lua
  - sql92
  - sql1999 (SQL:1999)
  - sql2003/sql (SQL:2003)
* New option for the Number highlighter: letterNoFollow
  If set, numbers may not contain a letter at the end. For example: 123kg will 
  not be seen as a number. This was the default before version 2.1
* New option for the Heredoc highlighter: flag
  Flags that can be put after the start. This parameter can be used more than 
  once. For example in the Bourne shell the following is valid start of a 
  heredoc section: <<-FOO. In this case '-' would be a flag.
* New options for the Keyword highlighter:
  - beginChars: a string of characters which should also be considered as 
    beginning part of an identifier. Together with partChars this will allow 
    you to extend the range of characters which make up an identifier in the 
    language. By default the Java functions Character.isJavaIdentifierStart
    and Character.isJavaIdentifierPart are used to find identifiers.
  - partChars: a string of characters which should also be considered as 
    part of an identifier.
  - exclusiveChars: this is a switch, if present only the characters defined 
    by beginChars and partChars will be considered as part of the identifiers. 
* Updated keywords for PHP 5.3 
* Added LINQ keywords to C# configuration
* Additional keywords added to Delphi configuration
* Basic plugin support to load additional highlighter implementations in Java.
