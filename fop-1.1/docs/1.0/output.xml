    <p>
      Apache&#8482; FOP supports multiple output formats by using a different renderer for each format.
      The renderers do not all have the same set of capabilities, sometimes because of 
      the output format itself, sometimes because some renderers get more development 
      attention than others.
    </p>

      <title>General Information</title>

        <title>Fonts</title>
        <p>
          Most FOP renderers use a FOP-specific system for font registration.
          However, the Java2D/AWT and print renderers use the Java AWT package, which gets its 
          font information from the operating system registration.
          This can result in several differences, including actually using different fonts, 
          and having different font metrics for the same font.
          The net effect is that the layout of a given FO document can be quite different between 
          renderers that do not use the same font information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Theoretically, there's some potential to make the output of the PDF/PS renderers match
          the output of the Java2D-based renderers. If FOP used the font metrics from its own
          font subsystem but still used Java2D for text painting in the Java2D-based renderers,
          this could probably be achieved. However, this approach hasn't been implemented, yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a work-around, it is possible to match the PDF/PS output in a Java2D-based
          renderer pretty closely. The clue is to use the
          <link href="intermediate.html">intermediate format</link>. The trick is to layout the
          document using FOP's own font subsystem but then render the document using Java2D.
          Here are the necessary steps (using the command-line):
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Produce an IF file: <code>fop -fo myfile.fo -at application/pdf myfile.at.xml</code><br/>
            Specifying "application/pdf" for the "-at" parameter causes FOP to use FOP's own
            font subsystem (which is used by the PDF renderer). Note that no PDF file is created
            in this step.
          </li>
          <li>Render to a PDF file: <code>fop -atin myfile.at.xml -pdf myfile.pdf</code></li>
          <li>Render to a Java2D-based renderer:
            <ul>
              <li><code>fop -atin myfile.at.xml -print</code></li>
              <li><code>fop -atin myfile.at.xml -awt</code></li>
              <li><code>fop -atin myfile.at.xml -tiff myfile.tiff</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <title>Output to a Printer or Other Device</title>
        <p>
          The most obvious way to print your document is to use the FOP 
          <link href="#print">print renderer</link>, which uses the Java2D API (AWT).
          However, you can also send output from the Postscript renderer directly to a Postscript 
          device, or output from the PCL renderer directly to a PCL device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are Windows command-line examples for Postscript and PCL:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[fop ... -ps \\computername\printer]]></source>
        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[fop ... -pcl \\computername\printer]]></source>
        <p>
          Here is some Java code to accomplish the task in UNIX:
        </p>
        <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("lp -d" + print_queue + " -o -dp -");
out = proc.getOutputStream();]]></source>
        <p>
          Set the output MIME type to "application/x-pcl" (MimeConstants.MIME_PCL) and 
          it happily sends the PCL to the UNIX printer queue.

      <title>PDF</title>
      <p>
        PDF is the best supported output format. It is also the most accurate
        with text and layout. This creates a PDF document that is streamed out
        as each page is rendered. This means that the internal page index
        information is stored near the end of the document.
        The PDF version supported is 1.4. PDF versions are forwards/backwards
        compatible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that FOP does not currently support PDF/A-1a. 
        Support for <link href="accessibility.html">Tagged PDF</link>, <link href="pdfa.html">PDF/A-1b</link> 
        and <link href="pdfx.html">PDF/X</link> has recently been added, however.

        <title>Fonts</title>
        <p>
          PDF has a set of fonts that are always available to all PDF viewers;
          to quote from the PDF Specification:

          <em>"PDF prescribes a set of 14 standard fonts that can be used without prior
          definition.
          These include four faces each of three Latin text typefaces (Courier,
          Helvetica, and Times), as well as two symbolic fonts (Symbol and ITC Zapf
          Dingbats). These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, are
          guaranteed to be available in all PDF viewer applications."</em>

      <section id="pdf-postprocess">
        <title>Post-processing</title>
        <p>
          FOP does not currently support several desirable PDF features: watermarks and signatures. 
          One workaround is to use Adobe Acrobat (the full version, not the Reader) to process 
          the file manually or with scripting that it supports.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another popular post-processing tool is <link href="http://www.lowagie.com/iText">iText</link>, 
          which has tools for adding security features, document properties, watermarks, and many 
          other features to PDF files.
        </p>
        <warning>
          Caveat: iText may swallow PDF bookmarks. But 
          <link href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37589">Jens Stavnstrup tells us</link>
          that this doesn't happen if you use iText's PDFStamper.
        </warning>
        <p>
          Here is some sample code that uses iText to encrypt a FOP-generated PDF. (Note that FOP now 
          supports <link href="pdfencryption.html">PDF encryption</link>. However the principles for using 
          iText for other PDF features are similar.)

      In addition to the <link href="#pdf-postprocess">PDF Post-processing</link> options, consider the following workarounds:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use a background image for the body region.
      </li>
      <li>
        (submitted by Trevor Campbell) Place an image in a
        region that overlaps the flowing text. For example, make
        region-before large enough to contain your image. Then include a
        block (if necessary, use an absolutely positioned block-container)
        containing the watermark image in the static-content for the
        region-before. Note that the image will be drawn on top of the
        normal content.

<section id="ps">
  <title>PostScript</title>
  <p>
    The PostScript renderer has been brought up to a similar quality as the 
    PDF renderer, but may still be missing certain features. It provides good 
    support for most text and layout.
    Images and SVG are not fully supported, yet. Currently, the PostScript
    renderer generates PostScript Level 3 with most DSC comments. Actually,
    the only Level 3 features used are the FlateDecode and DCTDecode 
    filter (the latter is used for 1:1 embedding of JPEG images), everything 
    else is Level 2.
  </p>
    <section id="ps-configuration">
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        The PostScript renderer configuration currently allows the following settings:
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="application/postscript">
  <auto-rotate-landscape>false</auto-rotate-landscape>
  <language-level>3</language-level>
  <optimize-resources>false</optimize-resources>
  <safe-set-page-device>false</safe-set-page-device>
  <dsc-compliant>true</dsc-compliant>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the "auto-rotate-landscape" setting is "false". Setting it
        to "true" will automatically rotate landscape pages and will mark them as landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "language-level" setting is "3". This setting specifies
        the PostScript language level which should be used by FOP. Set this to "2"
        only if you don't have a Level 3 capable interpreter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "optimize-resources" setting is "false". Setting it
        to "true" will produce the PostScript file in two steps. A temporary file will be
        written first which will then be processed to add only the fonts which were really
        used and images are added to the stream only once as PostScript forms. This will
        reduce file size but can potentially increase the memory needed in the interpreter
        to process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "safe-set-page-device" setting is "false". Setting it
        to "true" will cause the renderer to invoke a postscript macro which guards against
        the possibility of invalid/unsupported postscript key/values being issued to the
        implementing postscript page device. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "dsc-compliant" setting is "true". Setting it
        to "false" will break DSC compliance by minimizing the number of setpagedevice
        calls in the postscript document output.  This feature may be useful when unwanted
        blank pages are experienced in your postscript output.  This problem is caused by
        the particular postscript implementation issuing unwanted postscript subsystem
        initgraphics/erasepage calls on each setpagedevice call.

    <title>PCL</title>
    <p>
      This format is for the Hewlett-Packard PCL printers and other printers 
      supporting PCL. It should produce output as close to identical as possible 
      to the printed output of the PDFRenderer within the limitations of the
      renderer, and output device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output created by the PCLRenderer is generic PCL 5, HP GL/2 and PJL.
      This should allow any device fully supporting PCL 5 to be able to
      print the output generated by the PCLRenderer. PJL is used to control the
      print job and switch to the PCL language. PCL 5 is used for text, raster 
      graphics and rectangular fill graphics. HP GL/2 is used for more complex
      painting operations. Certain painting operations are done off-screen and
      rendered to PCL as bitmaps because of limitations in PCL 5.

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Text or graphics outside the left or top of the printable area are not 
          rendered properly. This is a limitation of PCL, not FOP. In general, 
          things that should print to the left of the printable area are shifted 
          to the right so that they start at the left edge of the printable area.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Helvetica and Times fonts are not well supported among PCL printers 
          so Helvetica is mapped to Arial and Times is mapped to Times New. This 
          is done in the PCLRenderer, no changes are required in the FO's. The 
          metrics and appearance for Helvetica/Arial and Times/Times New are 
          nearly identical, so this has not been a problem so far.
        </li>
        <li>For the non-symbol fonts, the ISO 8859-1 symbol set is used (PCL set "0N").</li>
        <li>
          All fonts available to the Java2D subsystem are usable. The texts are
          painted as bitmap much like the Windows PCL drivers do.
        </li>
        <li>Multibyte characters are not supported.</li>
        <li>
          At the moment, only monochrome output is supported. PCL5c color extensions
          will only be implemented on demand. Color and grayscale images are converted
          to monochrome bitmaps (1-bit). Dithering only occurs if the JAI image library
          is available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Images are scaled up to the next resolution level supported by PCL (75, 
          100, 150, 200, 300, 600 dpi). For color and grayscale images an even
          higher PCL resolution is selected to give the dithering algorithm a chance
          to improve the bitmap quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently, there's no support for clipping and image transparency, largely 
          because PCL 5 has certain limitations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="pcl-configuration">
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        The PCL renderer configuration currently allows the following settings:
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="application/vnd.hp-PCL">
  <rendering>quality</rendering>
  <text-rendering>bitmap</text-rendering>
  <disable-pjl>false</disable-pjl>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the "rendering" setting is "speed" which causes borders 
        to be painted as plain rectangles. In this mode, no special borders (dotted, 
        dashed etc.) are available. If you want support for all border modes, set the
        value to "quality" as indicated above. This will cause the borders to be painted
        as bitmaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "text-rendering" setting is "auto" which paints the
        base fonts using PCL fonts. Non-base fonts are painted as bitmaps through Java2D.
        If the mix of painting methods results in unwelcome output, you can set this
        to "bitmap" which causes all text to be rendered as bitmaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the "disable-pjl" setting is "false". This means that
        the PCL renderer usually generates PJL commands before and after the document
        in order to switch a printer into PCL language. PJL commands can be disabled
        if you set this value to "true".
      </p>
      <p>
        You can control the output resolution for the PCL using the "target resolution" 
        setting on the FOUserAgent. The actual value will be rounded up to the next
        supported PCL resolution. Currently, only 300 and 600 dpi are supported which
        should be enough for most use cases. Note that this setting directly affects
        the size of the output file and the print quality.

    <section id="pcl-extensions">
      <title>Extensions</title>
      <p>The PCL Renderer supports some PCL specific extensions which can be embedded

          The duplex-mode extension attribute on fo:simple-page-master allows to 
          select the duplex mode to be used for a particular simple-page-master.
          Example:
        </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
      <fo:layout-master-set>
        <fo:simple-page-master master-name="simple" pcl:duplex-mode="0">
          ...
        </fo:simple-page-master>
      </fo:layout-master-set>
]]></source>
        <p>
          Note: the duplex is a positive integer and the value depends on
          the target printer. Not all PCL printers support duplexing.
          Usually, 
          "0" is simplex,
          "1" is duplex (long-edge binding), 
          "2" is duplex (short-edge binding).

          Consult the technical reference for your printer for all available values.

      The FOP AFP Renderer deals with creating documents conforming to the IBM AFP document architecture
      also refered to as MO:DCA (Mixed Object Document Content Architecture).
    </p>
    <p>
      The mapping of XSL-FO elements to the major MO:DCA structures is as follows:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="1" rowspan="1">XSL-FO element</th>
        <th colspan="1" rowspan="1">MO:DCA-P object</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">fo:root</td>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Document</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">fo:page-sequence</td>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Page Group</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">fo:simple-page-master</td>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Page</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      FOP creates exactly one Document per Printfile with an optional Resource Group at the
      beginning. FOP does not create document indices.

      <title>Deployment in older environments</title>
      <p>
        There are still a big number of older (or limited) MO:DCA/IPDS environments in production
        out there. AFP has grown in functionality over time and not every environment supports the
        latest features. We're trying to make AFP output work in as many environments as possible.
        However, to make AFP output work on older environments it is recommended to set to
        configuration to 1 bit per pixel (see below on how to do this). In this case, all images
        are converted to bi-level images using IOCA function set 10 (FS10) and are enclosed in
        page-segments since some implementation cannot deal with IOCA objects directly.
        If a higher number of bits per pixel is configured, FOP has to switch to at least FS11
        which may not work everywhere.

      <title>Fonts</title>
      <p>The AFP Renderer requires special configuration particularly related to fonts.
      AFP Render configuration is done through the normal FOP configuration file. The MIME type
      for the AFP Renderer is application/x-afp which means the AFP Renderer section in the FOP configuration file
      looks like:</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="application/x-afp">
  <!-- AFP Renderer -->
  ...
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>There are 4 font configuration variants supported:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>IBM Raster fonts</li>
        <li>IBM Outline fonts</li>
        <li>IBM CID-keyed (Type 0) fonts</li>
        <li>FOP built-in Base14 fonts</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A typical raster font configuration looks like:</p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[      <!-- This is an example of mapping actual IBM raster fonts / code pages to a FOP font -->
        <font>
        <!-- The afp-font element defines the IBM code page, the matching Java encoding and the
             base URI for the font -->
        <afp-font type="raster" codepage="T1V10500" encoding="Cp500" base-uri="fonts/ibm/">
          <!-- For a raster font a separate element for each font size is required providing

        <font-triplet name="TimesNewRoman" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
      </font>]]></source>
      <p>An outline font configuration is simpler as the individual font size entries are not required.
      However, the characterset definition is now required within the afp-font element.</p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[      <font>
          <afp-font type="outline" codepage="T1V10500" encoding="Cp500" characterset="CZH200  "
             base-uri="file:/fonts/ibm" />
          <font-triplet name="sans-serif" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
          <font-triplet name="Helvetica" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
          <font-triplet name="any" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
      </font>
]]></source>
      <p>
        If "base-uri" is missing or a relative URI, the fonts are resolved relative to
        the font base URI specified in the configuration (or on the FopFactory).
      </p>
      <note>
        Previously, the location of the font files was given by the "path" attribute. This is still
        supported for the time being, but you should move to using the more flexible "base-uri"
        attribute so you can profit from the power of URI resolvers.
      </note>
      <p>A CID-keyed font (Type 0, double-byte outline font) configuration is much the same as an outline font.
      However, the characterset definition is now required within the afp-font element.</p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[      <font>
          <afp-font type="CIDKeyed" characterset="CZJHMNU" 
             codepage="T1120000" encoding="UnicodeBigUnmarked"
             base-uri="file:/fonts/ibm" />
          <font-triplet name="J-Heisei Mincho" style="normal" weight="normal" />
      </font>
]]></source>
      <p>
Note that the value of the encoding attribute in the example is the double-byte encoding 'UnicodeBigUnmarked' (UTF-16BE).
      </p>
      <p>Experimentation has shown that the font metrics for the FOP built-in Base14 fonts are actually
      very similar to some of the IBM outline and raster fonts. In cases were the IBM font files are not
      available the base-uri attribute in the afp-font element can be replaced by a base14-font attribute 
      giving the name of the matching Base14 font. In this case the AFP Renderer will take the
      font metrics from the built-in font.</p>

      <section id="afp-renderer-resolution-config">
        <title>Output Resolution</title>
        <p>By default the AFP Renderer creates output with a resolution of 240 dpi.
          This can be overridden by the &lt;renderer-resolution/&gt; configuration element. Example:</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[

      </section>
      <section id="afp-image-config">
        <title>Images</title>
        <p>By default the AFP Renderer converts all images to 8 bit grey level.
        This can be overridden by the &lt;images/&gt; configuration element. Example:</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
      <images mode="color" />
]]></source>
      <p>This will put images as RGB images into the AFP output stream. The default setting is:</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
      <images mode="b+w" bits-per-pixel="8" native="true"/>
]]></source>
      <p>Only the values "color" and "b+w" are allowed for the mode attribute.</p>
      <p>The bits-per-pixel attribute is ignored if mode is "color". For "b+w" mode is must be 1, 4, or 8.</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
      <images native="true"/>
]]></source>
      <p>When the native attribute is specified and set to "true", all image resources will be natively injected
      into the datastream using an object container rather than being converted into an IOCA FS45 image.
      Support for native image formats (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, GIF) is not always available on printer implementations
      so by default this configuration option is set to "false".</p>
      <p>
        Setting <code>cmyk="true"</code> on the <code>images</code> element will enable CMYK
        colors. This will only have an effect if the color mode is set to "color". Example:
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
      <images mode="color" cmyk="true"/>]]></source>
        <p>
          When the color mode is set to 1 bit (bi-level), the "dithering-quality" attribute can
          be used to select the level of quality to use when converting images to bi-level images.
          Valid values for this attribute are floating point numbers from 0.0 (fastest) to
          1.0 (best), or special values: "minimum" (=0.0), "maximum" (1.0),
          "medium" (0.5, the default). For the higher settings to work as expected, JAI needs to
          be present in the classpath. If JAI is present, 0.0 results in a minimal darkness-level
          switching between white and black. 0.5 does bayer-based dithering and 1.0 will use
          error-diffusion dithering. The higher the value, the higher the quality and the slower
          the processing of the images.
        </p>

        <title>Shading</title>
        <p>
          By default, filled rectangles are painted using their given color using a PTOCA I-axis rule
          (DIR). But not all environments handle these colors correctly. That's why a setting is
          supported that paints the rectangles using an ordered dither pattern (bi-level) with
          an inline IOCA FS10 image that is used together with the "replicate and trim" mapping.
          The optional "shading" element can be used to control the shading mode. Its default value
          is "color". To enable the dithered mode, use "dithered". Example:

      <title>Resource Group File</title>

      may be specified with the &lt;resource-group-file/&gt; configuration element.  Example:</p>

        <p>
          By default, bitmap image objects (or page segments derived from them) are put in the

        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible to override these defaults, either per image (see the

        <p>
          "goca" refers to GOCA graphics and "bitmap" refers to IOCA images. The possible values
          for the attributes are "inline" and "print-file". In the future,
          additional possibilities may be added.

        <p>The include-page-segment extension element can only occur within a simple-page-master.
        Multiple include-page-segment extension elements within a simple-page-master are allowed.
        The mandatory name attribute must refer to an 8 character 
        (space padded) resource name that must be known in the AFP processing environment.
        The value of the mandatory src attribute is compared against the value of the src attribute in
        fo:external-graphic elements and if it is identical (string matching is used) in the generated
        AFP the external graphic is replaced by a reference to the given resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect here is that whenever FOP encounters the URI specified in the extension,
          it will effectively generate code to include the page segment with the given name
          instead of embedding the image referenced by the URI. The URI is still required as
          the underlying image serves as a provider for the intrinsic size of the image
          (At the moment, FOP is unable to extract the intrinsic size of the page segment from
          an AFP resource file). For the image to appear in an AFP viewer or to be printed, the
          AFP resource must be available on the target device. FOP does not embed the page
          segment in the generated file. Please also note that page segments cannot be scaled.
          They are always rendered in their intrinsic size.

          Apache FOP supports embedding an external form map resource in the

          extension. An example: 
        </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
<fo:root xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format"

  </fo:declarations>
]]></source>
        <p>
          The <code>afp:include-form-map</code> is to be placed as a direct child of
          <code>fo:declarations</code>. The <code>name</code> is an AFP resource name
          (max. 8 characters) and the <code>src</code> attribute is the URI identifying the
          external form map resource. When such a form map is embedded, you can use the
          <code>afp:invoke-medium-map</code> extension (described above) to invoke any medium
          map included in the form map. 
        </p>
        <note>
          Apache FOP doesn't support a way to define a form map or medium map using XML means
          inside an XSL-FO document. You will have to build the form map with some third-party
          tool.

  <title>RTF</title>
  <p>
    JFOR, an open source XSL-FO to RTF converter has been integrated into Apache FOP.
    This will create an RTF (rich text format) document that will
    attempt to contain as much information from the XSL-FO document as
    possible. It should be noted that is not possible (due to RTF's limitations) to map all
    XSL-FO features to RTF. For complex documents, the RTF output will never reach the feature
    level from PDF, for example. Thus, using RTF output is only recommended for simple documents
    such as letters.
  </p>
  <p>
    The RTF output follows Microsoft's RTF specifications
    and produces best results on Microsoft Word.
  </p>
  <note>RTF output is currently unmaintained and lacks many features compared to other output
    formats. Using other editable formats like Open Document Format, instead of producing XSL-FO
    then RTF through FOP, might give better results.</note>
  <p>
    These are some known restrictions compared to other supported output formats (not a complete list):
  </p>
  <ul>

      Not supported/implemented:

    </p>
    <p>
      The AWT viewer shows a window with the pages displayed inside a

    <p>
      If you run into the problem that the printed output is incomplete on Windows:
      this often happens to users printing to a PCL printer.
      There seems to be an incompatibility between Java and certain PCL printer drivers

      switching to the PostScript printer driver for that printer model.

  <title>Bitmap (TIFF/PNG)</title>
  <p>
    It is possible to directly create bitmap images from the individual

    This is done with the same code that renders to the Java2D/AWT renderer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, two output formats are supported: PNG and TIFF. TIFF produces
    one file with multiple pages, while PNG output produces one file per
    page. Note: FOP can only produce multiple files (with PNG output) if
    you can set a <code>java.io.File</code> indicating the primary PNG file
    using the <code>FOUserAgent.setOutputFile(File)</code> method.
  </p>
  <p>
    The quality of the bitmap depends on the target resolution setting 
    on the FOUserAgent and on further settings described below.
  </p>
    <section id="bitmap-configuration">
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        The TIFF and PNG renderer configuration currently allows the following settings:
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="image/png">
  <color-mode>rgba</color-mode>
  <transparent-page-background>true</transparent-page-background>
  <background-color>white</background-color>
  <anti-aliasing>true</anti-aliasing>
  <rendering>quality</rendering>
  <fonts><!-- described elsewhere --></fonts>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the <code>"color-mode"</code> setting is <code>"rgba"</code> which
        is equivalent to a 24bit RGB image with an 8bit alpha channel for transparency.
        Valid values are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>rgba</code>: RGB with alpha channel (24bit + 8bit = 32bit)</li>
        <li><code>rgb</code>: RGB (24bit)</li>
        <li><code>gray</code>: gray (8bit)</li>
        <li><code>bi-level</code> (or <code>binary</code>): bi-level (1bit)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please note that there is currently no dithering or error diffusion available for bi-level
        bitmap output.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the <code>"transparent-page-background"</code> setting is
        <code>"false"</code> which paints an opaque, white background for the whole image.
        If you set this to <code>"true"</code>,
        no such background will be painted and you will get a transparent image if
        an alpha channel is available in the output format.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the <code>"background-color"</code> setting is <code>"white"</code>.
        The color specifies in which color the page background is painted. It will only be
        painted if <code>"transparent-page-background"</code> is not set to <code>"true"</code>.
        All XSL-FO colors (including color functions) can be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the <code>"anti-aliasing"</code> setting is <code>"true"</code>.
        You can set this value to <code>"false"</code> to disable anti-aliasing and
        thus improve rendering speeds a bit at the loss of some image quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default value for the <code>"rendering"</code> setting is <code>"true"</code>.
        You can set this value to <code>"false"</code> to improve rendering speeds a bit
        at the loss of some image quality. If this setting has an actual effect depends
        on the JVM's Java2D backend.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="tiff-configuration">
      <title>TIFF-specific Configuration</title>
      <p>
        In addition to the above values the TIFF renderer configuration allows some additional
        settings:
      </p>
<source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<renderer mime="image/tiff">
  <transparent-page-background>true</transparent-page-background>
  <compression>CCITT T.6</compression>
  <fonts><!-- described elsewhere --></fonts>
</renderer>]]></source>
      <p>
        The default value for the "compression" setting is "PackBits" which 
        which is a widely supported RLE compression scheme for TIFF. The set of compression
        names to be used here matches the set that the Image I/O API uses. Note that
        not all compression schemes may be available during runtime. This depends on the
        actual codecs being available. Here is a list of possible values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>NONE</code> (no compression)</li>
        <li><code>PackBits</code> (RLE, run-length encoding)</li>
        <li><code>JPEG</code></li>
        <li><code>Deflate</code></li>
        <li><code>LZW</code></li>
        <li><code>ZLib</code></li>
        <li><code>CCITT T.4</code> (Fax Group 3)</li>
        <li><code>CCITT T.6</code> (Fax Group 4)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This setting may override any setting made using the <code>"color-mode"</code>. For example, if
        <code>"CCITT T.6"</code> is selected, the color mode is automatically forced to <code>"bi-level"</code> because
        this compression format only supports bi-level images.
      </p>
      <note>
        If you want to use CCITT compression, please make sure you've got
        <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/current.html">
          Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools
        </link>
        in your classpath. The Sun JRE doesn't come with a TIFF codec built in, so it has to be
        added separately. The internal TIFF codec from XML Graphics Commons only supports PackBits,
        Deflate and JPEG compression for writing.

      <title>Runtime Rendering Options</title>
      <p>
        The IF-based bitmap output implementations support a rendering option with the key
        "target-bitmap-size" (value: java.awt.Dimension) that allows to force the pages to
        be proportionally fit into a bitmap of a given size. This can be used to produce
        thumbnails or little preview images of the individual pages. An example:
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[userAgent.getRenderingOptions().put(
    "target-bitmap-size", new Dimension(320, 200));]]></source>

</section>
<section id="txt">
  <title>TXT</title>
  <p>
    The text renderer produces plain ASCII text output
    that attempts to match the output of the PDFRenderer as closely as
    possible. This was originally developed to accommodate an archive system
    that could only accept plain text files, and is primarily useful for getting
    a quick-and-dirty view of the document text. The renderer is very limited,
    so do not be surprised if it gives unsatisfactory results.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Text renderer works with a fixed size page buffer. The size of this
    buffer is controlled with the textCPI and textLPI public variables.
    The textCPI is the effective horizontal characters per inch to use.
    The textLPI is the vertical lines per inch to use. From these values
    and the page width and height the size of the buffer is calculated.
    The formatting objects to be rendered are then mapped to this grid.
    Graphic elements (lines, borders, etc) are assigned a lower priority
    than text, so text will overwrite any graphic element representations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because FOP lays the text onto a grid during layout, there are frequently 
    extra or missing spaces between characters and lines, which is generally 
    unsatisfactory.
    Users have reported that the optimal settings to avoid such spacing problems are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>font-family="Courier"</li>
    <li>font-size="7.3pt"</li>
    <li>line-height="10.5pt"</li>

     <warning>The SVG renderer is in the sandbox and may not work as expected in FOP Trunk!!! Please help us improve this feature.</warning>
     <p>
       This format creates an SVG document that has links between the pages.
       This is primarily for slides and creating svg images of pages.
       Large documents will create SVG files that are far too large for
       an SVG viewer to handle. Since FO documents usually have text the
       SVG document will have a large number of text elements.
       The font information for the text is obtained from the JVM in the
       same way as for the AWT viewer. If the SVG is viewed on a
       system where the fonts are different, such as another platform,
       then the page may look wrong.
