      <title>System Requirements</title>
      <p>The following software must be installed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Java 1.4.x or later Runtime Environment.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Many JREs &gt;=1.4 contain older JAXP implementations (which often contain bugs). It's
              usually a good idea to replace them with a current implementation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Apache&#8482; FOP. The <link href="../download.html">FOP distribution</link> includes all libraries that you will
          need to run a basic FOP installation. These can be found in the [fop-root]/lib directory. These
          libraries include the following:
          <ul>
            <li><link class="fork" href="ext:xmlgraphics.apache.org/commons">Apache XML Graphics Commons</link>, an shared library for Batik and FOP.</li>
            <li><link class="fork" href="ext:batik">Apache Batik</link>, an SVG library.</li>
            <li><link class="fork" href="ext:commons-logging">Apache Commons Logging</link>, a logger abstraction kit.</li>
            <li><link class="fork" href="ext:commons-io">Apache Commons IO</link>, a library with I/O utilities.</li>
            <li><link class="fork" href="ext:excalibur/framework">Apache Excalibur/Avalon Framework</link>, for XML configuration handling.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following software is optional, depending on your needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Graphics libraries. Generally, FOP contains direct support for the most important
          bitmap image formats (including PNG, JPEG and GIF). See
          <link href="graphics.html">FOP: Graphics Formats</link> for details.
        </li>
        <li>
          PDF encryption. See <link href="pdfencryption.html">FOP: PDF Encryption</link> for details.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, the following system requirements apply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you will be using FOP to process SVG, you must do so in a graphical environment.
          See <link href="graphics.html#batik">FOP: Graphics (Batik)</link> for details.

        <p>
          Basic FOP installation consists of first unzipping the <code>.gz</code> file that is the
          distribution medium, then unarchiving the resulting <code>.tar</code> file in a
          directory/folder that is convenient on your system. Please consult your operating system
          documentation or Zip application software documentation for instructions specific to your
          site.

        <title>Problems</title>
        <p>
          Some Mac OSX users have experienced filename truncation problems using Stuffit to unzip
          and unarchive their distribution media. This is a legacy of older Mac operating systems,
          which had a 31-character pathname limit. Several Mac OSX users have recommended that
          Mac OSX users use the shell command <code>tar -xzf</code> instead.

      <section id="fop-script">
        <title>Using the fop script or batch file</title>
      <p>
        The usual and recommended practice for starting FOP from the command line is to run the
        batch file fop.bat (Windows) or the shell script fop (Unix/Linux).
        These scripts require that the environment variable JAVA_HOME be
        set to a path pointing to the appropriate Java installation on your system. Macintosh OSX
        includes a Java environment as part of its distribution. We are told by Mac OSX users that
        the path to use in this case is <code>/Library/Java/Home</code>. <strong>Caveat:</strong>
        We suspect that, as Apple releases new Java environments and as FOP upgrades the minimum
        Java requirements, the two will inevitably not match on some systems. Please see
        <link href="http://developer.apple.com/java/faq">Java on Mac OSX FAQ</link> for information as
        it becomes available.

      <p>
        PDF encryption is only available if FOP was compiled with encryption support
        <strong>and</strong> if compatible encryption support is available at run time.
        Currently, only the JCE is supported. Check the <link href="pdfencryption.html">Details</link>.

        <title>Writing your own script</title>
        <p>FOP's entry point for your own scripts is the class
<code>org.apache.fop.cli.Main</code>. The general pattern for the
        command line is: <code>java -classpath &lt;CLASSPATH&gt;
        org.apache.fop.cli.Main &lt;arguments&gt;</code>. The arguments
        consist of the options and infile and outfile specifications
        as shown above for the standard scripts. You may wish to review
        the standard scripts to make sure that
        you get your environment properly configured.

        <title>Running with java's <code>-jar</code> option</title>
      <p>
        As an alternative to the start scripts you can run <code>java
        -jar path/to/build/fop.jar &lt;arguments&gt;</code>, relying on
        FOP to build the classpath for running FOP dynamically, see <link href="#dynamical-classpath">below</link>. If you use hyphenation,
        you must put <code>fop-hyph.jar</code> in the <code>lib</code>
        directory.
      </p>

      <p>You can also run <code>java -jar path/to/fop.jar
      &lt;arguments&gt;</code>, relying on the <code>Class-Path</code>
      entry in the manifest file. This works if you put
      <code>fop.jar</code> and all jar files from the <code>lib</code>
      directory in a single directory. If you use hyphenation, you
      must also put <code>fop-hyph.jar</code> in that directory.</p>

      <section id="dynamical-classpath">
        <title>FOP's dynamical classpath construction</title>

        <p>If FOP is started without a proper classpath, it tries to
          add its dependencies dynamically. If the system property
          <code>fop.home</code> contains the name of a directory, then
          FOP uses that directory as the base directory for its
          search. Otherwise the current working directory is the base
          directory. If the base directory is called <code>build</code>,
          then its parent directory becomes the base directory.</p>

        <p>FOP expects to find <code>fop.jar</code> in the
          <code>build</code> subdirectory of the base directory, and
          adds it to the classpath. Subsequently FOP adds all
          <code>jar</code> files in the lib directory to the
          classpath. The lib directory is either the <code>lib</code>
          subdirectory of the base directory, or, if that does not
          exist, the base directory itself.</p>

        <p>If the system property <code>fop.optional.lib</code>
          contains the name of a directory, then all <code>jar</code>
          files in that directory are also added to the classpath. See
          the methods <code>getJARList</code> and
          <code>checkDependencies</code> in
          <code>org.apache.fop.cli.Main</code>.</p>

    <section id="check-input">
      <title>Using Xalan to Check XSL-FO Input</title>
      <p>
        FOP sessions that use -xml and -xsl input instead of -fo input are actually
        controlling two distinct conversions: Tranforming XML to XSL-FO, then formatting
        the XSL-FO to PDF (or another FOP output format).
        Although FOP controls both of these processes, the first is included merely as
        a convenience and for performance reasons.
        Only the second is part of FOP's core processing.
        If a user has a problem running FOP, it is important to determine which of these
        two processes is causing the problem.
        If the problem is in the first process, the user's stylesheet is likely the cause.
        The FOP development team does not have resources to help with stylesheet issues,
        although we have included links to some useful
        <link href="../resources.html#specs">Specifications</link> and
        <link href="../resources.html#articles">Books/Articles</link>.
        If the problem is in the second process, FOP may have a bug or an unimplemented
        feature that does require attention from the FOP development team.
      </p>
      <note>The user is always responsible to provide correct XSL-FO code to FOP.</note>
      <p>
        In the case of using -xml and -xsl input, although the user is responsible for
        the XSL-FO code that is FOP's input, it is not visible to the user. To make the
        intermediate FO file visible, the FOP distribution includes the "-foout" option
        which causes FOP to run only the first (transformation) step, and write the
        results to a file. (See also the Xalan command-line below)
      </p>
      <note>
        When asking for help on the FOP mailing lists, <em>never</em> attach XML and
        XSL to illustrate the issue. Always run the XSLT step (-foout) and send the
        resulting XSL-FO file instead. Of course, be sure that the XSL-FO file is
        correct before sending it.
      </note>
      <p>
        The -foout option works the same way as if you would call the
        <link href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/commandline.html">Xalan command-line</link>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>java org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process -IN xmlfile -XSL file -OUT outfile</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that there are some subtle differences between the FOP and Xalan command-lines.

    </section>
    <section id="memory">
      <title>Memory Usage</title>
      <p>
        FOP can consume quite a bit of memory, even though this has been continually improved.
        This is partly inherent to the formatting process and partly caused by implementation choices.
        All FO processors currently on the market have memory problems with certain layouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are running out of memory when using FOP, here are some ideas that may help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Increase memory available to the JVM. See
          <link href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/solaris/java.html">the -Xmx option</link>
          for more information.
          <warning>
            It is usually unwise to increase the memory allocated to the JVM beyond the amount of
            physical RAM, as this will generally cause significantly slower performance.
          </warning>
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid forward references.
          Forward references are references to some later part of a document.
          Examples include page number citations which refer to pages which follow the citation,
          tables of contents at the beginning of a document, and page numbering schemes that
          include the total number of pages in the document
          (<link href="../faq.html#pagenum">"page N of TOTAL"</link>).
          Forward references cause all subsequent pages to be held in memory until the reference
          can be resolved, i.e. until the page with the referenced element is encountered.
          Forward references may be required by the task, but if you are getting a memory
          overflow, at least consider the possibility of eliminating them.
          A table of contents could be replaced by PDF bookmarks instead or moved to the end of
          the document (reshuffle the paper could after printing).
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid large images, especially if they are scaled down.
          If they need to be scaled, scale them in another application upstream from FOP.
          For many image formats, memory consumption is driven mainly by the size of the image
          file itself, not its dimensions (width*height), so increasing the compression rate
          may help.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use multiple page sequences.
          FOP starts rendering after the end of a page sequence is encountered.
          While the actual rendering is done page-by-page, some additional memory is
          freed after the page sequence has been rendered.
          This can be substantial if the page sequence contains lots of FO elements.
        </li>
      </ul>
