      <p>
        Apache&#8482; <strong>FOP Trunk</strong> is the name for the current
        development code as found in the <link href="ext:svn-repo/trunk">Subversion repository</link>. This
        section of the FOP web site provides the documentation for
        this version.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apache FOP team is proud to present to you this production quality codebase. It has taken
        over three years to get this far and over two years without a new release from the FOP
        project. We're still in the process of adding new features. We welcome any feedback you
        might have and even more, any other form of help to get the project forward.
