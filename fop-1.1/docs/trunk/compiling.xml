        FOP distributions are either pre-compiled binary or source.
        If you are using a binary distribution, it is already built and there is no need to build it again. 
        See the <a href="../download.html">Download Instructions</a> for information about whether a 
        binary or source distribution is best for your needs.

      <p>
        Apache&#8482; FOP snapshots are either pre-compiled binary or source.
        If you are using a binary snapshot, it is already built and there is no need to build it again. 
        If you got the source code from a repository snapshot or via Subversion you will need to build FOP.
        See the <link href="../download.html">Download Instructions</link> for information about where to obtain binary or repository snapshots, and whether a 
        binary or source snapshot is best for your needs.

        <title>JDK</title>
        <p>
          Building FOP requires a minimum Java Development Kit (JDK/SDK) of 1.4
          (A Java Runtime Environment is not sufficient).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="env-classpath">
        <title>CLASSPATH</title>
        <p>
          There is generally no need to setup a classpath. All libraries needed to compile FOP are included 
          in the source distribution and are referenced by the build script.
          You will only need to adjust the classpath if you build FOP in some other way. See the build 
          script build.xml for details.
        </p>

      <section id="env-java-home">
        <title>JAVA_HOME</title>
        <p>
          The build script uses <link href="ext:ant">Apache Ant</link>, a popular 
          Java-based build tool, which usually requires that the environment variable JAVA_HOME point to 
          your local JDK root directory. This is true even if you use JDK 1.4 or above, which normally 
          does not need this setting.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="env-ant">
        <title>Apache Ant</title>
        <p>
          <link href="ext:ant">Apache Ant</link> (Version 1.7 or later) must be installed in order to
          build FOP. Following best practices we don't include Ant with FOP anymore. You can find the
          <link href="ext:ant/manual/">instructions to install Ant in the Ant manual</link> on the web.
        </p>

    <section id="build-script">
      <title>Run the Build Script</title>
      <p>
        Change to the FOP root directory and build FOP by executing the build script (build.xml)
        using the "ant" command.
      </p>
      <note>
        The "ant" command is only available on your system if you've properly 
        <link href="ext:ant/manual/">installed Apache Ant</link> and added Ant's location to the PATH 
        environment variable.
      </note>
      <p>
        The file build.xml in the FOP root directory is the blueprint that Ant uses for the build. It 
        contains information for numerous build targets, many of which are building blocks to more 
        useful target, and others which are primarily used by the FOP developers.
        You may benefit from looking through this file to learn more about the various build targets.
        To obtain a complete list of useful build targets:
      </p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[ant -projecthelp]]></source>
      <p>The most useful targets are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>package</strong>: Generates the JAR files (default). This is the normal build that 
          produces a jar file usable for running FOP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>clean </strong>: Cleans the build directory. This is useful for making sure that 
          any build errors are cleaned up before starting a new build. It should not ordinarily be 
          needed, but may be helpful if you are having problems with the build process itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>javadocs</strong>: Creates the FOP API documentation.
          <note>A minimum JDK version of 1.4.2 is required for generating the javadocs.</note>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To run the build:</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[ant [target ...]]]></source>
      <p>For example to do a normal build for the "all" target (which is the default):</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[ant]]></source>
      <p>OR</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[ant all]]></source>
      <p>To clean the build directory first:</p>
      <source xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[ant clean all]]></source>
      <note>
        If you want to shorten the build time you can just call the "package" target which
        doesn't perform any automated tests during the build.

      <p>If you have problems building FOP, please try the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Run the build with the target of "clean", then rerun the build.</li>
        <li>Delete the build directory completely, then rerun the build.</li>
        <li>
          Make sure you do not have a non-FOP version of xerces.jar, xalan.jar, batik.jar, 
          or another dependency product somewhere in your CLASSPATH.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the build still fails, see the <link href="../gethelp.html">Getting Help</link> 
          page for further help.
